title: Brain Tumor Detection Algorithm Based on Improved YOLOv7
abstract: A brain tumor detection algorithm based on improved YOLOv7 is proposed to
  address the problem of low image resolution in detecting small targets in brain
  tumor detection. By introducing the SPD module in the Backbone section, cross row
  convolution and pooling operations are eliminated, ﬁne-grained feature learning
  is strengthened, and the accuracy of model detection is increased; Introducing CA
  attention mechanism to enhance the learning of more critical and effective features,
  further improving the efﬁciency and accuracy of the network model; And use the dynamic
  non monotonic frequency modulation loss function Wise-IoU to enhance the model’s
  detection ability for low-quality samples. Overall improved YOLOv7 network model
  signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of low resolution samples and small object detection,
  and can be effectively applied to the detection of brain tumor images.
