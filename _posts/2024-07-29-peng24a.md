title: Fusing Adaptive Meta Feature Weighting for Few-shot Object Detection
abstract: "Few-shot object detection models often lack the perceptual ability to detect
  the target objects and fine-tuning the model on base class images to quickly adapt
  to new tasks can lead to feature shift issues. We propose an Adaptive Meta-Feature
  Weighting (AMFW-YOLO) object detection model for solving these problems. This model
  introduces an attention mechanism based on spatial and channel-wise squeeze-and-excitation
  (scSE) blocks, which helps the model focus on the regions of interest in the target
  samples and suppresses interference from background regions. Additionally, to compensate
  for the feature shift caused during the fine-tuning stage, we design an Adaptive
  Meta-Feature Weighting module (AMFW), This module embeds positional information
  into spatial features, captures long-range dependencies along two directions, and
  adaptively compensates for the weights of deep global features, effectively improving
  the accuracy of the model.\r "
