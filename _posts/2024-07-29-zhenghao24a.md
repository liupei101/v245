title: Construction and Evaluation of a Metabolic Syndrome Prediction Model Based
  on Classiﬁcation Algorithms
abstract: 'Exploring the risk factors inﬂuencing Metabolic Syndrome (MS), constructing
  a risk prediction model based on multiple classiﬁcation algorithms, comparing the
  predictive performance of different models for MS, and interpreting the models to
  derive speciﬁc MS prediction rules, providing scientiﬁc basis for MS prediction.
  A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 2,193 MS patients.
  Based on whether the patients developed MS, they were divided into a healthy group
  and an MS group. Statistical correlation tests were used to identify the risk factors
  associated with MS. Six classiﬁcation algorithms, including decision trees, logistic
  regression, random forests, naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and support vector
  machines, were employed to build an MS prediction model. The prediction model’s
  performance was evaluated using R language by generating receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) curves. Among the 2,193 MS patients, the incidence rate of MS was 34.66%.
  Signiﬁcant differences (P¡0.05) were observed between the healthy group and the
  MS group in terms of age, marital status, income, ethnicity, waist circumference,
  body mass index (BMI), uric acid levels, blood glucose levels, high-density lipoprotein
  levels, and triglyceride levels. Blood glucose, waist circumference, BMI, and triglycerides
  showed a signiﬁcant linear correlation with MS. The ROC curve results indicated
  that the random forest algorithm achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94
  (95% CI: 0.914-0.957), logistic regression achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.867-0.925),
  support vector machines achieved an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.859-0.920), decision
  trees achieved an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.831-0.905), K-nearest neighbors achieved
  an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.770-0.850), and naive Bayes achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95%
  CI: 0.694-0.785). The study results conﬁrmed that factors such as age, marital status,
  waist circumference, BMI, blood glucose levels, and triglyceride levels are all
  risk factors for developing MS. Furthermore, the random forest and logistic regression
  models demonstrated excellent performance in predicting MS.'
