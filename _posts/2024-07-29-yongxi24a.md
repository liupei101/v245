title: Hybrid Classical Quantum Neural Network with High Adversarial Robustness
abstract: As the realms of quantum computing and machine learning converge, a novel
  domain, termed quantum machine learning, is progressively forming within the sphere
  of artiﬁcial intelligence studies. Nonetheless, akin to its classical counterpart,
  this emerging ﬁeld is not exempt from security vulnerabilities. Quantum machine
  learning systems, regardless of whether they process classical or quantum inputs,
  are susceptible to minor perturbations that can erroneously skew classiﬁcation outcomes.
  These minute disruptions, often imperceptible to human observation, present a signiﬁcant
  challenge in ensuring the integrity of quantum classiﬁers. As the complexity of
  quantum classiﬁers increases, their vulnerability also gradually grows. To mitigate
  this issue, this paper proposes a novel hybrid classical-quantum neural network
  model that enhances the model’s adversarial robustness by adding a preprocessing
  layer for noise reduction and data reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that
  this model exhibits higher efﬁciency and accuracy in noisy environments and against
  adversarial attacks.
