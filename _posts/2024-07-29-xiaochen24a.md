title: Predicting Student Performance with Graph Structure Density-Based Graph Neural
  Networks
abstract: 'Educational data mining is a key area in data mining, focusing on predicting
  student performance. This research offers a new perspective for EDM, aiding educators
  in timely interventions based on performance predictions to reduce student failure
  and improve teaching quality. A novel approach: Graph Structure Density-based Sampling-Aggregation
  (GSDSA), is presented. GSDSA effectively reduces computational costs and improves
  training efficiency by limiting the number of neighbor nodes and using the Jaccard
  coefficient to measure node similarity. Moreover, it also considers relationships
  among students, employing the Pearson correlation coefficient to analyze none-graph-structured
  data, enhancing its processing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that
  GSDSA surpasses various graph neural networks and machine learning algorithms in
  classification accuracy.'
