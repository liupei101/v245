title: Federated Learning Algorithm based on Gaussi-an Local Differential Noise
abstract: In differential privacy-based federated learning, the data of different
  clients are of-ten independently and identically distributed. During model training,
  each client’s data will optimize and converge towards its own optimal direction,
  causing a client drift phenomenon, resulting in a decrease in accuracy and making
  it difﬁcult to obtain the optimal global model. To address this issue, a federated
  learning al-gorithm based on local differential privacy is proposed. Each client
  is assigned its own control variable ci to control the model update direction, and
  a global control variable c is set on the server side. The SCAFFOLD algorithm is
  used to aggregate all client model parameters and control variables. During model
  training, a correction term c-ci is added when updating parameters on the client
  side, and the model training bias is adjusted according to the global control variable
  obtained from the server side in the previous round, thereby controlling the model’s
  iterative direction towards the global optimum. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10
  datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the new algorithm.
