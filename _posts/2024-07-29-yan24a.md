title: A Truth Discovery Method with Trust-Aware Self-Supervised Model for Visual
  Crowdsensing
abstract: "Crowdsensing relies on truth discovery methods to obtain reliable data.
  However, existing truth dis-covery methods for Crowd Sensing systems face challenges
  in effectively evaluating the quality of uploaded image data by workers and defending
  against attacks by malicious workers. To overcome these issues, we introduce a truth
  discovery method with the trust-aware self-supervised discrim-inative (SSD) model
  for visual crowdsensing, namely TASSD. In the TASSD, we incorporate the worker’s
  trustworthiness in the reweighting mechanism of the SSD model, thereby improving
  system robustness and reliability. Then, we designed a trust update method to accurately
  obtain the worker’s trustworthiness. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
  of our proposed TASSD over traditional anomaly detection methods, particularly in
  scenarios with high ratios of abnormal data. TASSD effectively addresses disguised
  malicious worker attacks that achieve high credibility.\r "
