title: Event Extraction in Complex Sentences Based on Dependency Parsing and Longformer
abstract: Event extraction involves the identification and extraction of specific
  event-related information from a large corpus of textual data. In recent years,
  the introduction of pre-trained models has significantly enhanced the ability of
  these models to comprehend the semantics of sentences, leading to continuous advancements
  in event extraction methods. However, when it comes to long and complex sentences,
  these models have shown limited performance. This limitation can be attributed to
  the intricate structures of such sentences, which hinder the modelsâ€™ ability to
  grasp their semantic meaning. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model
  that combines dependency analysis tools with the Longformer pre-trained model. By
  effectively analyzing the structures of complex sentences, our model aims to enhance
  the semantic understanding of these sentences. Experimental results using the ACE2005
  dataset demonstrate the improved performance of our model in event extraction for
  complex sentences.
