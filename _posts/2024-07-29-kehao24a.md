title: Detection Method of Forest Pests Based on Attention Mechanism and Lightweight
  YOLOv5
abstract: In view of the forestry pest identiﬁcation research is less, manual identiﬁcation
  time-consuming and labor-intensive low accuracy. An attention-based and lightweight
  YOLOv5 forestry pest identiﬁcation method was proposed. First of all, the traditional
  backbone network CSPDarknet is modiﬁed to the improved ShufﬂeNetV2, which simpliﬁes
  the network structure and makes the network more lightweight; Secondly, the hybrid
  attention mechanism CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) is introduced to
  increase the perception ability of cyberspace and channel features while keeping
  the parameters and calculation load basically unchanged. Finally, the loss function
  is replaced by WIoU to improve model training to speed up model convergence and
  improve regression accuracy. The average detection accuracy of the improved model
  is 89.9%, which is 3.6% higher than that of the original YOLOv5s algorithm; The
  parameters decreased by 3213050 and the calculation amount decreased by 7.8. The
  improved model improves the detection accuracy and reduces the parameters and calculation
  amount. Compared with other advanced algorithms, the algorithm in this paper has
  excellent performance, which can provide reference for forest pest identiﬁcation
  and management.
