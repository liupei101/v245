title: 'SpcNet: Speaker Validation Model Based on Self-Calibrated Convolution'
abstract: The convolutional module-based speaker representation network has demonstrated
  outstanding performance in the speaker verification (SV) task and has now become
  one of the widely adopted network structures in this task field. There are some
  limitations to the convolution-based network structure, specifically with the fixed-size
  convolution kernel in the general convolution operation. This makes it difficult
  to capture long-range time-frequency and channel dependencies in speech features,
  limiting the network’s ability to extract representations of the speaker. To overcome
  this issue, we have explored several alternative approaches. Firstly, we propose
  an enhanced selfcalibrating convolutional kernel that adaptively constructs long-range
  time-frequency and channel dependencies around each time-frequency position. This
  allows for the integration of richer information, significantly enhancing the network’s
  capacity to learn representations. Secondly, we have made adjustments to the network
  structure to improve the extraction of speaker feature representations. We refer
  to this modified model as SpcNet. In this paper, our proposed SpcNet model has been
  experimented on the datasets VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2. Comprehensive experiments
  show that the Equal Error Rate (EER) is significantly improved.
