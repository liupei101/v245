title: A Sound Source Location Method Based on Time Difference of Arrival with Improved
  Dung Beetle Optimizer
abstract: In microphone array sound source localization based on Time Difference of
  Arrival (TDOA), traditional methods for solving the nonlinear equations of TDOA
  lead to signiÔ¨Åcant deviations and lower accuracy. To address this issue, this paper
  proposes a TDOA-based sound source localization method using an Improved Dung Beetle
  Optimizer (IDBO) algorithm. This method enhances the performance of the Dung Beetle
  Optimizer (DBO) by employing strategies such as chaotic mapping, golden sine, and
  adaptive tdistribution, and applies it to sound source localization. To evaluate
  the performance of the IDBO, it is compared with DBO, Harris Hawk Optimizer (HHO),
  Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Bald Eagle Search (BES) algorithm, and Whale Optimization
  Algorithm (WOA). The results showed that in solving benchmark functions and localization
  models, it demonstrates faster convergence speed, higher localization accuracy,
  and better stability.
