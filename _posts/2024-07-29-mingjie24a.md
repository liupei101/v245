title: A Tree-Structure Enhanced Transformer for Cardinality Estimation
abstract: Accurate cardinality estimation is crucial for query optimization by guiding
  plan selection. Traditional cardinality estimation approaches often fail to provide
  precise estimates, leading to suboptimal query plans. In recent years, learning-based
  methods have emerged as a promising alternative. For tree-based learning methods,
  a conventional way to simply encode nearby parent-child pairs and learn by iteratively
  training hampers the performance. But it leads to a signiÔ¨Åcant loss of structural
  information and incurs substantial computational overhead by the iterative training
  process. In this paper, we proposed a tree-structure positional encoding scheme.
  It can not only extract effective features for each node, but also capture the inherent
  structural characteristics of the tree. Based on the tree-based feature, we designed
  a novel transformer-based cardinality estimation model, which enhances the parallelism
  of the model training process and reduces the overhead caused by iterative training.
  On real-world datasets, our method beats the current state-of-the-art techniques,
  QF, by 25% in terms of mean qerror.
