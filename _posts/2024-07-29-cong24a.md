title: 'Research on Green Design Optimization of Ethnic Minority Architecture in Guangxi
  Based on Machine Learning '
abstract: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as one of China’s ethnic minority areas,
  possesses rich heritage resources in ethnic architecture, with dual objectives of
  cultural preservation and ecological sustainability. This paper explores the design
  principles of ethnic minority architecture in Guangxi, investigates the relationship
  between architecture and climate adaptability, and integrates them with digital
  fabrication technology. Utilizing parametric platforms and performance simulation
  tools, the study examines the climate adaptability of ethnic minority architecture
  in Guangxi. Through machine learning, models for lighting, thermal, and humidity
  environments speciﬁc to Guangxi’s ethnic minority regions are developed. Optimization
  parameters for architectural design are proposed, and the reliability and accuracy
  of the models are demonstrated through training and testing, providing ecological
  design optimization strategies and references for future research on green architecture
  in ethnic minority areas.
