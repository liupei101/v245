title: Hybrid Neural Network Model for Extracting Character Relationships that Integrates
  Multi-level Information
abstract: "In the realm of natural language processing, extracting entity relationships
  in Chinese holds paramount importance, serving as the bedrock for various downstream
  tasks. However, the complexity entrenched within Chinese linguistic structures and
  semantic nuances presents formidable challenges. To surmount these obstacles, our
  study proposes a sophisticated neural network model meticulously designed to integrate
  multi-level information for relationship extraction. By segmenting sentences into
  distinct components, entity-adjacent words and the sentence. The model capitalizes
  on the strengths of BERT pretrained models for dynamic word embedding. Furthermore,
  leveraging Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU) and Convolutional Neural
  Networks (CNN) at the sentence level enables the capture of both sequential and
  structural features. At the entity-adjacent word level, a fusion of two fully connected
  neural networks extracts intricate associations between entities and neighboring
  words. Rigorous ablation and comparative experiments conducted on a comprehensive
  corpus underscore the efficacy of our proposed approach. Remarkably, compared to
  benchmark methods, our model exhibits a substantial 6.61% increase in recall rate
  and a note-worthy 5.31% improvement in the F1 value.\r "
