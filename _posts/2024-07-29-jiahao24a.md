title: Conversational Recommendation System Based on Utterance Act and Emotion
abstract: "Conversational recommendation system (CRS) aims to acquire user preferences
  of conversation and then make recommendations to users. Existing CRS enhance the
  characterization of items by introducing external information to improve the recommendation
  effect, but they ignore the most essential utterance semantic attributes in the
  dialogue, and do not fully consider the different emotion or act feedback of users.
  Based on this, this paper fully explores the utterance semantics, makes the construction
  of user characteristics fuller by extracting the act and emotion of the utterance,
  and predicts the act of the conversation process, and then enhances the response
  through the emotional vocabulary, to improve the interaction experience between
  the user and the system. A large number of experiments on public datasets show that
  the model proposed in this paper outperforms the most advanced methods.\r "
