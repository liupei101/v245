title: A Word Sense Disambiguation Method Based on Multiple Sense Graph
abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation is a process to determine the best meaning of
  an ambiguous word according to its contextual semantic information. Many methods
  ofWord Sense Disambiguation cannot deal with polysemous words well because they
  only consider the meaning of the adjacent words before and after ambiguous words,
  and cannot consider the meaning of all words in the sentence globally. In order
  to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a word sense disambiguation method
  based on Multiple Sense Graph. This method applies the BERT model to generate word
  sense vectors, and globally considers the feature relationship between the ambiguous
  word and all words in the context. In addition, this method applies the PageRank
  algorithm to score the importance of each sense vector of the word, and the scoring
  results are sorted to obtain the best sense of the ambiguous word. The experimental
  results indicate that the proposed BERT-PageRank method improves the evaluation
  index compared with the other two semantic disambiguation methods. In summary, the
  proposed method improves the accuracy of word sense disambiguation to obtain the
  best word sense.
