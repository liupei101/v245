title: Extended F-expansion Method and Its Application to the Variable-coefﬁcient
  Fractional Nonlinear Schro¨dinger Equation
abstract: In this paper, under the deﬁnition of conformable fractional derivatives,
  we use the extended Fexpansion method and obtain the exact solution of the variable-coefﬁcient
  factional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (FNLSE), including rational function solutions
  and Jacobi elliptic function solution. When the mode m of these solutions tends
  to 1 and 0, the hyperbolic function solution, triangular function solution, and
  light and dark solitary wave solution are obtained. The correlation diagram of the
  exact solution is plotted, and the effect of different parameters on the solution
  structure is deeply analyzed. By selecting a large number of parameters and comparing
  the graphical analysis of different solutions obtained using this method, we have
  identiﬁed properties related to the nonlinear Schro¨dinger equation with variable
  coefﬁcients and summarized relevant theorems.
