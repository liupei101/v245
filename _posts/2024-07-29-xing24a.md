title: Trafﬁc Sign Detection Algorithm Based on Improved YOLOv5
abstract: Due to the phenomenon of small size, complex background or high density
  of trafﬁc signs, there is a certain degree of missing or false detection, which
  ultimately leads to the problem of reduced detection accuracy. To solve this problem,
  a real-time trafﬁc sign detection algorithm based on YOLOv5s is proposed. Firstly,
  feature upsampling is carried out through ContentAware ReAssembly of Features upsampling
  operator in the neck network, which can aggregate information in the large receptive
  ﬁeld, so that the network can get a more accurate feature map. Secondly, the normalized
  Gaussian Wasserstein distance is used as the similarity measure to construct the
  NIOU regression bounding box loss function to improve the overall performance of
  the model. Finally, the FasterNet module is used instead of the C3 module, which
  is lighter and faster. Experiments were carried out on TT100K data set. Compared
  with YOLOv5s, CNF-YOLO algorithm reduced Parameters by 1/5, the computing load decreased
  by 3GFLOPs, the detection speed increased by 18.4 frames/SEC and the weight ﬁle
  decreased by 2.1MB. All models were lighter. And its mAP@0.5 has also been increased
  by 0.5% to enable rapid detection of trafﬁc signs.
