title: Attention-Enhanced Pointer Network for Summarization with Key Information
abstract: "Addressing the limitations of mainstream generative text summarization
  models, such as poor semantic quality, inappropriate allocation of weights to key
  information, and constraints in extracting the semantic essence of textual content
  by existing natural language generation models, we propose an Attention-Augmented
  Pointer Generation Network (AUPT). This model utilizes TextRank technology to extract
  crucial information, combines positional encoding with an adaptive masking mechanism
  to enhance positional attention scores, emphasizing the importance of key information
  in the textâ€™s semantics. Furthermore, by integrating the T5-Pegasus model with the
  pointer generation network, it effectively handles unknown vocabulary and replication
  issues, enabling more accurate and reliable semantic representations.\r "
