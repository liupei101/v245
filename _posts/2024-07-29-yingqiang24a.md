title: Research on Personalized Music Recommendation Model Based on Personal Emotion
  and Collaborative Filtering Algorithm
abstract: 'In today’s digital age, music plays an important role in people’s lives,
  but the current music recommendation system is mainly based on content, the use
  of collaborative ﬁltering and other algorithms, can not according to the user’s
  real-time emotional state, recommend suitable for the current mood of the music.
  This paper aims to design and implement a personalized music recommendation model
  based on personal emotional information and collaborative ﬁltering algorithm. The
  model mainly includes two sub-models: the emotion and music selection tendency model
  and the music recommendation model based on collaborative ﬁltering algorithm. By
  analyzing the user’s emotional state and music preference, the model provides music
  recommendation services that are more in line with the user’s psychological state,
  so as to improve the user experience and recommendation accuracy. The model designed
  in this paper can effectively solve the problem that personalized music recommendation
  cannot be performed according to the user’s real-time emotion. At the same time,
  it can also be used as a reference for other personalized recommendation models.'
