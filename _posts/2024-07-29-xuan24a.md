title: Hierarchical Clustering with Dynamic Time Warping for Automatic Detection and
  Labeling of Triggering Asynchrony in Patient-Ventilator Interaction during Mechanical
  Ventilation
abstract: The patient-ventilator asynchronies in the ICU can signiﬁcantly impact the
  management and prognosis of mechanical ventilation. Currently, machine learning
  methods have shown promise in ef- fectively identifying patient-ventilator asynchrony
  (PVA). However, there is still a lack of training datasets for PVA detection. In
  this study, a hierarchical clustering with dynamic time warping (DTW) method is
  presented to perform automatic identiﬁcation and labeling of trigger asynchrony
  waveforms within our abnormal breathing cycle dataset for automatic identiﬁcation
  and labeling of abnormal waveform datasets in mechanical ventilation, thereby reducing
  the workload of hand labeling. The experimental results show that our method can
  efﬁciently identify both ineffective triggering and double triggering from a large
  amount of abnormal ventilation data. These two types of trigger abnormalities are
  widely observed in patient-ventilator asynchronies (PVAs) during mechanical ventilation.
  Automatically identifying and annotating these abnormalities is crucial for reducing
  the burden of manual labeling, promoting the creation of PVA training datasets.
