title: Hierarchical Quantization Algorithm for Deep Learning Network Models
abstract: Deep learning network models have achieved inspiring performances in various
  ﬁelds such as computer vision, natural language processing, and biomedicine. However,
  the high computational and storage costs of the models restrain their application
  in resource-limited situations. However, due to the increased com-plexity and computation
  of deep neural networks, there are still some challenges in deploying deep learning
  models into real-world applications for resource-constrained devices. To address
  this problem, researchers have proposed various quantization algorithms to decrease
  the expenditure of calculation and storage in deep learning models. This thesis
  addresses the problem of hierarchical quantization of deep learning models and proposes
  a simple hierarchical quantization algorithm that aims to effectively reduce the
  computation and storage requirements of deep learning network models and maintain
  the accuracy of the models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical
  quantization method, we conducted experiments on several classical deep learning
  models. Our experiments prove our approach can better maintain the models’ accuracy
  while reduc-ing the storage and computation requirements compared to the traditional
  quantization algorithms.
