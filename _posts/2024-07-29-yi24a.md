title: Construction Method for Knowledge Graph of Driving Behavior under Adverse Weather
abstract: "Weather condition are important factors affecting vehicle driving; However,
  the existing research results of weather factors on vehicle driving behavior are
  relatively scattered, and it is difficult to make effective decision analysis. Knowledge
  graph is one of the mainstream forms of knowledge base organization, which can clearly
  express the complex relationships between different objects. Therefore, introducing
  knowledge graph into driving behavior management is of great significance to improve
  decision making ability. This study analyzes the characteristics of driving behavior
  affected by weather, and constructs the knowledge expression model of “weather condition–environmental
  condition–driving behavior”. On this basis, a representation method based on characteristic
  value is proposed, and then the driving behavior knowledge graph is constructed.
  This method can clearly express the comprehensive relationship between weather condition
  and driving behavior, and provide support for vehicle driving behavior decision
  under complex weather condition. We take the existing relevant standards in the
  field of Meteorology and road traffic laws and regulations as examples to verify
  the practicability of the method. It lays a foundation for the construction of the
  knowledge graph of weather factors affecting driving behavior for autonomous vehicles
  in the future.\r "
