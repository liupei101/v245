title: Fusion Analysis and Digital Realization of Inspection and Repair of High-Speed
  Railway Engineering Equipment
abstract: High-speed railway engineering equipment is the basis of railway transportation,
  and transportation safety is closely related to the equipment operating state. In
  order to help inspectors and managers of the engineering departments to conduct
  inspection and repair more efﬁciently, solve problems such as the lack of intuitiveness
  of inspection status, unreasonable setting of inspection cycle days, and frequent
  occurrence of equipment accidents caused by seasonal weather changes, this paper
  uses deep learning to establish an automatic disease recognition model based on
  Convolutional Neural Network. Through the data collected from several high-speed
  railway workshops for veriﬁcation, it is concluded that the model can realize the
  automatic recognition of disease types, the training accuracy reaches 97%, and the
  veriﬁcation accuracy reaches 76%. Meanwhile, based on big data technology, this
  paper combines Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Neural Network,
  establishes the equipment status judgment model, and builds the inspection cycle
  algorithm based on equipment status. Through the data collected from multiple engineering
  departments, the equipment state judgment model can capture the key information
  from the inspection records and can thus accurately judge the equipment operating
  status. The accuracy of the predicted inspection times reaches 85.7%. Finally, through
  the digital implementation case, it is fully proved that the design and fusion of
  these two applications can provide sufﬁcient technical support for the inspection
  and repair of high-speed railway engineering equipment and can thus provide a comprehensive
  and reliable data basis for real-time and efﬁcient inspection and repair decisions.
