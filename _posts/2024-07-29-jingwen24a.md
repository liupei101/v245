title: Utilization of a Full Convolutional Autoencoder for the Task of Anomaly Detection
  in Hyperspectral Imagery
abstract: "The advancement of artificial intelligence has significantly improved the
  capability to capture back-ground features in hyperspectral images (HSI), thereby
  demonstrating commendable performance in the domain of hyperspectral anomaly detection
  (HAD). The existing approaches, however, still exhibit certain limitations: (1)
  The deep feature learning process lacks contextual, anomaly constraints, and prior
  information. (2) The priority reconstruction of the background cannot be ensured
  by traditional HSI anomaly detectors based on self-supervised deep learning. (3)
  The utilization of spatial information in hyperspectral images is limited by the
  fully connected deep network structure of the HSI anomaly detector. The performance
  of many hyperspectral anomaly detectors is limited by assumptions or presumptions
  regarding background and anomaly distributions, as these detectors cannot accurately
  account for the complex real-world distributions. The paper proposes a self-supervised
  full convolutional autoencoder as a solution to address these issues. The effectiveness
  and performance of the method were confirmed through evaluation on two real hyperspectral
  datasets, demonstrating superiority over nine other state-of-the-art methods.\r "
