title: City Gas Load Forecasting Based on PCCs-CNN-LSTM Model
abstract: The forecast of urban gas load is of great signiﬁcance for the safety and
  stability of gas supply, to ensure the normal production activities of residents.
  The inﬂuence factors of sunshine duration were introduced, and the nine identiﬁed
  inﬂuencing factors were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCCs). According
  to the correlation, the optimal input was selected one by one. The inﬂuencing factors
  with high correlation were used as the input of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  and Long short-term memory (LSTM), respectively, to forecast the daily load, monthly
  load and quarterly load of urban gas, and verify their accuracy and effectiveness.
  The results show that the optimal number of input factors for daily load forecasting
  and monthly load forecasting is 5, and the optimal number of input factors for quarterly
  load forecasting is 8. For daily load forecasting, the absolute percentage errors
  of monthly load forecasting and quarterly load forecasting of PCS- CNN-LSTM model
  are 3.94%, 4.61% and 5.73% respectively. The root mean square error and mean absolute
  error of PCS-CNN-LSTM model are better than that of a single LSTM model.
