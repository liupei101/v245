title: Characterization Study of Online Public Opinion Based on Natural Language Processing
  with Weibo Data
abstract: "In the summer of 2022, “Ice cream assassin” has emerged as a prominent
  buzzword on the Chinese Internet. With its vast user base of 582 million monthly
  active users, Sina Weibo serves as an ideal platform for analyzing information disseminated
  within its ecosystem. This platform not only enables us to discern prevailing public
  sentiment but also facilitates governmental efforts in shaping and regulating the
  public opinion landscape. This study encompasses a collection of 60,228 Weibo pertaining
  to “ice cream assassin” posted on Sina Weibo. By employing sentiment analysis algorithm
  based on Bert’s fine-tuned model, we analyze temporal shifts in emotional trends,
  summarize changes in public sentiment, and categorize variations in popularity levels.
  Furthermore, through semantic network analysis, we identify two distinct thematic
  segments within this realm of public opinion. This study has important implications
  for assessing the impact of online public opinion on the economy and even society.\r "
