title: 'Enhancing Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging: Blood UNet with Interpretable
  Insights'
abstract: "Researching anomaly detection in medical imaging, particularly in blood
  samples, is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This article is to devise
  a robust method using Blood UNet, a modified U Net architecture integrated with
  Lesion Enhancing Network (LEN) and Shape Model (SHAP), to improve anomaly detection
  precision. Specifically, the research involves preprocessing the BloodMNIST, training
  the Blood UNET model, and interpreting its predictions using LEN and SHAP. Experimental
  results on BloodMNIST showcase the efficacy of identifying anomalies within blood
  samples. This study highlights the importance of leveraging advanced techniques
  like LEN and SHAP in medical diagnostics, contributing to better patient care and
  healthcare efficiency.\r "
