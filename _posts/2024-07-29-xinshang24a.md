title: A Multi-attribute Large Group Decision-making Method Based on Interval-valued
  Pythagorean Fuzzy Number
abstract: Firstly, a large group clustering algorithm based on data similarity is
  proposed, which can set different thresholds to cluster the decision results of
  expert groups. Secondly, the interval-valued pythagorean fuzzy number (IVPFN) hesitancy
  accuracy function and hesitancy score function are proposed. And based on the consideration
  of the distance between centroids and rectangular area in the geometric meaning
  of IVPFN, a calculation formula is proposed to distinguish different IVPFNs. Thirdly,
  use the above formula to construct a weight calculation model for evaluation criteria
  with adjustment coefﬁcients. The decision matrix is weighted and its relative distance
  from the positive and negative ideal solutions is calculated to produce the ﬁnal
  ranking. Finally, the cultural tourism project decision-making problem is analyzed
  as an arithmetic example and compared with the methods in the literature of other
  related ﬁelds to illustrate the rationality and scientiﬁcity of this paper.
