title: Ships Collision Avoidance Based on Quadrangle Ship Domain and Reciprocal Velocity
  Obstacle
abstract: Navigating the narrow and congested waters of the Yangtze River in China
  poses a signiÔ¨Åcant challenge, leading to frequent ship-ship and ship-buoy collisions.
  In most cases of collisions between ships and buoys, the ship often hits and runs.
  This paper introduces a novel collision-avoidance decision method that employs the
  RVO (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles) and QSD (Quantitative Ship Domain) to enable
  dynamic obstacle avoidance for ship-to-buoy and ship-to-ship, which complies with
  conventions on the international regulation for preventing collision at sea. QSD
  can dynamically adjust the ship domain model according to different speeds to address
  different encounter situations. The combination of RVO and QSD combines the dynamic
  ship domain with the obstacle avoidance algorithm, which makes the water transport
  safer than the traditional obstacle avoidance algorithm. In addition, this paper
  also compares the effects of VO (Velocity obstacle) and RVO, and the results indicate
  that RVO has smoother obstacle avoidance.
