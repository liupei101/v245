title: Chinese Named Entity Recognition Method Based on Lexicon and Convolution-Integrated
  Self-Attention
abstract: "Chinese Named Entity Recognition methods primarily consist of span-based
  approaches and sequence-to-sequence methods. However, the former focuses solely
  on the recognition of entity boundaries, while the latter is susceptible to exposure
  bias. To address these issues, a Chinese NER method based on dictionary enhancement
  and self-attention fusion convolution is proposed. Initially, the text is encoded
  using the pre-trained model ERNIE 3.0 and lexical representations. Then, Bi-LSTM
  is utilized to further capture the contextual information of the sequence, resulting
  in the final character representations. Subsequently, a two-dimensional (2D) grid
  is constructed for modeling character pairs, and a feature integration layer is
  developed by merging self-attention mechanisms and convolution to refine and capture
  the interactions between characters. Finally, a joint predictor composed of a dual-affine
  classifier and multilayer perceptrons is used to predict entity categories. Experimental
  results demonstrate that this method can effectively recognize both flat and nested
  named entities. Compared to the current best-performing baseline models, the proposed
  method achieves an increase of 0.14% and 2.53% in F1 scores on the flat datasets
  Resume and Weibo, respectively, and an improvement of 0.52% in F1 score on the nested
  dataset ACE2005.\r "
