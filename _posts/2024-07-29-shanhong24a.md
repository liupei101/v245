title: Reordering CAE Matrix using Hierarchical Clustering
abstract: Traversing a high-dimensional mesh using 1-D trajectory is a widely used
  technique in the ﬁelds of CAE computing and data management. Such a trajectory is
  widely known as a space-ﬁlling curve. Nevertheless, most of the space ﬁlling curves,
  such as Z-curve or Hilbert curve, are designed for structured meshes. Therefore,
  it is vital to design an effective space-ﬁlling curve for unstructured meshes. In
  this paper, we propose a space-ﬁlling curve for unstructured mesh by considering
  the original problem as a graph clustering problem. We generate a hierarchical clustering
  schema and uses depth-ﬁrst search to traverse the hierarchical schema. In this way,
  the sequence of the depth-ﬁrst search naturally be-comes a 1-D trajectory. Compared
  with traditional space-ﬁlling curves, our solution can effectively handle traversing
  problems on unstructured meshes.
