title: Research on Features Extraction and Classification for Images based on Transformer
  Learning
abstract: "Image processing and analysis have become an essential method in many areas
  including medical impact, facial recognition, and social media analysis. With the
  rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, especially
  the emergence of Transformer learning models, new methods have been brought to image
  feature extraction and classification. However, the existing transformer model limits
  the ability to handle variable-length sequences and understand complex sequence
  relationships. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based framework that
  combines a self-attention mechanism and a multi-head attention technique to efficiently
  extract features from complex image data. In addition, we introduce an improved
  classifier that enables efficient image classification using extracted features.
  Our method takes into account not only the local features of the image but also
  the global relationships between different regions to achieve a more accurate representation
  of the features. We simulate our model with existing convolutional neural networks
  and other traditional machine learning methods in the public datasets including
  CIFAR-10 and MNIST. From our experimental results, we can observe that our transformer-learning-based
  framework shows significant performance improvement in image feature extraction
  and classifica-tion tasks.\r "
