title: Light Weight Apple Defect Detection by Gaussian Mixture Model and Attention
  Mechanism
abstract: "To improve the speed and accuracy of online apple defect detection, a modified
  PP-PicoDet model based on mixed Gaussian color modeling and spatial attention mechanism
  is proposed. Firstly, in order to enhance the detection performance of small and
  low-contrast defects, the method constructs an offline color model based on GMM
  theory and builds a saliency numerical channel that integrates the saliency of anomalous
  targets on RGB data. Secondly, the SE mechanism of the network is optimized, integrating
  the CBAM (convolution block attention module) structure to enhance the perception
  of structural features in anomalous regions through strengthened spatial attention
  mechanisms. Furthermore, the abnormal loss function is adjusted by employing a Gaussian
  model to establish a label assignment loss function strategy, simplifying parameter
  tuning and improving the modelâ€™s motivation for small proportion defects. This enhancement
  aims to improve the detection performance of the model under conditions of imbalanced
  samples. Experiments indicate that the algorithm, implemented on a self-built application
  platform using real-world datasets, achieved a 5.6% increase in accuracy and a 5.8%
  increase in recall at the cost of only 0.5% time delay. The algorithm meets the
  requirements of timeliness and reliability for detecting defects online, contributing
  to the enhancement of efficiency in apple quality grading and production.\r "
