title: Multiscale Fusion and Boundary Refinement UNet Model for Lung Parenchyma Segmentation
abstract: "Methods based on automatic computer-aided systems for lung cancer diagnosis
  have gained popu-larity in recent years. Lung parenchyma segmentation technology
  plays an important role in these methods. To reduce the gradient loss, improve the
  feature utilization, and alleviate the difficulty of fully mining the contextual
  information in lung parenchyma segmentation, this study proposes a network model
  for lung parenchyma segmentation based on a Multiscale fusion and Boundary Refinement
  UNet (MBR–UNet) model. First, along the encoding path, the features are efficiently
  extracted by a Residual–Residual block module. Next, along the decoding path, a
  multiscale at-tention–spatial pyramid pooling module fully integrates the feature
  maps of different layers and sums the outputs of each layer of the decoding path
  for boundary refinement. Finally, the training model is optimized through a hybrid
  loss function. The proposed model is experimentally evaluated on the lung segmentation
  dataset of the Kaggle competition. The accuracy, Dice similarity coefficient, intersection
  ratio, and Hausdorff distance of the network segmentation are improved by 98.79%,
  97.35%, 96.34%, and 12.82 mm, respectively, from those of other segmentation methods.
  According to these results, the method can more precisely segment pulmonary parenchyma
  than the existing methods.\r "
