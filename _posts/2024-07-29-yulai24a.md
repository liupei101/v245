title: Research on Multi-UAV Task Allocation Algorithm Considering Dynamic Priority
  Changes
abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found increased application
  across various domains. Clusters of Multi-UAV can accomplish more complex tasks,
  optimizing overall efﬁciency through rational task allocation. In practical scenarios,
  they exhibit distinct advantages and characteristics. However, the allocation of
  tasks to Multi-UAV in special environments or emergency conditions poses a widely
  studied problem. Existing research or methods often impose ﬁxed task priorities
  (task sequences) during Multi-UAV task allocation. Yet, real-world UAV operations
  may witness ﬂuctuations in task priorities due to environmental changes or human
  factors. For instance, areas experiencing a drop in temperature may heighten the
  urgency of certain supplies, or sudden outbreaks of disease may increase the demand
  for medical supplies. In such cases, conventional planning methods become inadequate.
  Hence, this paper addresses these scenarios by proposing a model for dynamic task
  priority changes in Multi-UAV task allocation within special environments. This
  thesis introduces an improved genetic algorithm, termed the improved partheno geneticgreedy
  combination algorithm. Through comparative experiments, the efﬁcacy of the proposed
  algorithm in addressing dynamic priority changes in Multi-UAV collaborative task
  allocation problems is validated, enhancing problem-solving efﬁciency.
