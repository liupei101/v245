title: Prediction of Momentum in Tennis Using Random Forest Based on Bayesian Optimization
  and LSTM-ARIMA model
abstract: Athletes’ performances are often inﬂuenced by an intangible factor, momentum,
  which reﬂects the ability to perform exceptionally or consistently at a speciﬁc
  moment. Our model quantiﬁes momentum and predicts match win rates, aiding athletes
  and coaches in optimizing their game strategies. We analyzed factors such as break
  points and winning streaks, employing a Random Forest Model to evaluate momentum’s
  inﬂuence. Through the SHAP model, we established a quantiﬁable relationship with
  momentum and considered previous momentum using exponential weighted moving averages
  (EWMA). We developed a Gaussian Distribution Maximum Distance (GDMD) Threshold and
  utilized an LSTM-ARIMA model to predict momentum differences and identify turning
  points. The most critical factors were winning break points, running distance, and
  runs of success. Players are advised to be aware of their opponents’ turning points
  and conserve energy to break them. Potential improvements include considering external
  factors like audience impact and expected goals, as well as incorporating more data
  to enhance model generalization capability.
