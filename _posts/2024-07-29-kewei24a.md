title: Research on Random Forest Regression Algorithms for Predicting Reynolds Stress
  Anisotropy in Separation Flow around Near-Wall Cylinder
abstract: Standard RANS model is widely used in turbulence modelling and numerical
  simulation, due to its linear assumption of eddy viscosity, it is not suitable to
  accurately predict the Reynolds stress, especially in separated ﬂows with anisotropy
  of Reynolds stress. In this study, a machine learning model is proposed by applying
  the random forest regression algorithm to learn the deviation between eddyviscosity
  and high-ﬁdelity models for separation ﬂows around nearwall cylinder. The output
  features which represent magnitude, shape and directions of Reynolds stress are
  extracted by decomposing Reynolds stress tensor, while 8 types of input features
  are extracted from raw local ﬂow data sets to represent the main physical characteristics
  of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Both input and output features satisfy Galilean invariance, which
  contributes to improving prediction accuracy and generalization performance of the
  random forest regression model. The results show that the random forest regression
  model has a great potential to effectively predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy
  distribution of different Reynolds numbers.
