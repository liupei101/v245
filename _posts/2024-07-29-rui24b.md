title: Forecasting Tennis Player Matches Based on Machine Learning
abstract: This paper aims to highlight the extensive potential of analytics with the
  use of machine learning to improve sports modelling. We propose a supervised machine
  learning approach to further extend the optimization of machine learning in predicting
  the ﬂow of points in tennis matches. Using data sourced from the 2023 Wimbledon
  Gentlemen’s singles matches, we used Grey Relational Analysis and membership functions
  from fuzzy set theory to extract and rank 7 features that exhibit impactful ties
  with the player’s match outcome, which includes player’s serve status, games won
  in current set, ranking difference, distance covered, serve speed, previous victory
  status, and unforced error, respectively. We implemented these features to build
  3 supervised models and compare their predictive performances, namely K-Nearest
  Neighbours, XGBoost and Logistic Regression. We adopted a train test split measure
  of 300 training sets and 100 testing sets. Using performance metrics such as confusion
  matrices, ROC curves, F1, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy scores, we constructed
  a scoring table to rank implemented models. Our results demonstrated that XGBoost
  exhibited the most signiﬁcant predictive performance, followed by KNN and Logistic
  Regression. 5-Fold cross-validation feature stability and sensitivity analysis suggests
  that the feature space cre- ated is robust and stable where features are not easily
  subject to change in short-term predictions.
