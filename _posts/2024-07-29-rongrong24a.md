title: Biomedical Relation Extraction Based on Deep Transfer Learning and Prompt Learning
abstract: Biomedical Relationship Extraction (BioRE) is an important task for electronic
  health record mining and biomedical knowledge base construction. Due to the complexity
  of biomedical information in the literature, it is difficult to realize the construction
  of large-scale datasets. Although previous models showed good results in a fully
  supervised environment, they did not generalize well to the low resource situation
  common in this field. We propose a biomedical relationship extraction model based
  on deep transfer learning and prompt learning. We use deep neural network for transfer
  learning, using large-scale biomedical field data set (BioREx) training model. The
  trained model was applied to low-resource datasets in biomedical field, which can
  make the model to learn more rich knowledge, so as to alleviate the problem of insufficient
  training data. In addition, we used a prompt learning method by appending a prompt
  sentence describing the desired relationship label to the beginning of the input
  sentence, which can reduce the gap between the pretrained language model (PLM) and
  downstream tasks. Experiments show that using deep transfer learning and prompt
  learning can effectively improve the prediction results. Experiments on three BioRE
  benchmark datasets DrugProt, DDI and BC5CDR, F1 values are significantly improved
  compared to previous models.
