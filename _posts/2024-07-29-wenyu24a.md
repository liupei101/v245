title: Polynomial Fitting Based on Integrable Deep Neural Networks for Landau-Energy
  of Ferroelectrics
abstract: Fitting the Landau-Energy polynomial has always been challenging because
  it is difﬁcult to directly obtain Landau-Energy data for coefﬁcient ﬁtting. One
  possible approach to address this problem is to handle the derivative of the Landau-Energy
  polynomial with respect to the second-order polar- ization (dielectric constant)
  to obtain relevant information about the Landau-Energy. This chapter will introduce
  a method based on integrable neural networks to obtain an approximate model for
  the Landau-Energy polynomial and its parameters.
