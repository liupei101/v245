title: Thesis Reviewer Recommendation Based on Multi-Graph Neural Networks
abstract: "Thesis review is a crucial step in ensuring the quality of academic theses,
  and accurately recom-mending reviewers for theses is currently a problem that needs
  to be addressed. When reviewer information is incomplete, it is difficult to achieve
  good recommendation results. This paper pro-poses a Multi-Graph Neural Network algorithm
  for review reviewer recommendation in thesis re-view. Based on the keyword-reviewer
  bipartite graph, a graph neural network model is constructed. By utilizing graph
  neural networks, high-order relationships between reviews and keywords can be explored,
  enabling the discovery of reviewsâ€™ implicit research interests and expanding their
  re-search interests to some extent. Additionally, incorporating keyword-keyword
  interaction graphs and review-review interaction graphs allows for information exchange
  operations in the two graphs separately, enhancing the representation of keywords
  and reviews. We conducted experiments on real thesis reviews and compared the proposed
  algorithm with other recommendation algorithms. The results show that the proposed
  algorithm achieves favorable results across various evaluation metrics, demonstrating
  the effectiveness of the algorithm presented in this paper.\r "
